title: CPU Usage for Aix LPARs
agents: os
catalog: os/kernel

distribution: MIS
description:
 This check monitors the usage of CPUs on Aix LPARs, handling 4 possible configurations:
 * Dedicated/Capped
 * Dedicated/Donating
 * Shared/Capped
 * Shared/Uncapped
 different logic is used by the agent to gather data for the different cases. No
 prior knowledge of LPAR configuration is required or needed on the CheckMK
 server side of things.

 Configuration data comes from the command "lparstat", while CPU usage is derived
 from the average of vmstat data gathered over a short period of time. Default
 period is 5 seconds.

 It is probably best to run this script as a cached agent plugin.

item:
 Nothing

examples:
 # Set default levels for all LPARs
 aix_lpar_cpu_defaults["pct_usage_levels"] = (90.0, 95.0)

 # Set the number of minutes for the moving average calculation
 aix_lpar_cpu_defaults["avg_min"] = 30

 check_parameters = [
    # Hosts with tag "production" get custom levels
    ( {'pct_usage_levels' : (50.0, 80.0) } }, ['production', ], ALL_HOSTS, ALL_SERVICES ),
 ] + check_parameters

perfdata:
 the check reports both the value and an average of the metrics (num_usage and pct_usage).

inventory:
 This check supports inventory.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): this check supports the new parameters dictionary format.

{"pct_usage_levels"}: Warning and critical % cpu usage levels (float)
{"num_usage_levels"}: Warning and critical number of cores usage levels (float)
{"avg_min"}: Warning and critical syscalls rate levels (int)

[configuration]
aix_lpar_cpu_defaults: Default levels for pct_usage, num_usage and avg min.
